Explain to me, in beginner terms, how to retrieve information from an app with code?
Sure! Let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understand APIs**: Many apps provide what's called an "API" (Application Programming Interface). An API is like a set of rules and tools that allow different software applications to communicate with each other. It's like a waiter taking your order and giving it to the kitchen, and then bringing your food back to you.

2. **Find the Documentation**: Look for the documentation for the app you want to retrieve information from. This documentation will tell you how to use the API, what kind of information you can get, and how to get it.

3. **Authentication**: Sometimes, apps require you to prove that you're allowed to access their information. This is called authentication. It's like showing your ID to prove you're old enough to buy alcohol. The documentation will tell you how to authenticate yourself.

4. **Make Requests**: Once you understand how to use the API and how to authenticate yourself (if needed), you can start making requests. Requests are like asking for specific information from the app. You tell the app what you want, and it gives it to you.

5. **Receive Responses**: After making a request, the app will send you a response. This response will contain the information you asked for. It's like the waiter bringing your food back to you after you ordered it.

6. **Parse the Data**: Often, the information you get back from the app will be in a format called JSON or XML. This is like getting a recipe that you need to read and understand. You'll need to use code to "parse" this data, which means extracting the information you need from it.

7. **Use the Data**: Once you've extracted the information you need from the response, you can use it in your code however you like. Maybe you want to display it in your own app, or do some calculations with it, or save it to a file.

So, in summary, to retrieve information from an app with code, you need to understand its API, make requests to that API, receive and parse the responses, and then use the information you've retrieved. It's like asking a waiter for a dish, receiving it, and then using it however you want.
